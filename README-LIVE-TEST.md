# ðŸš€ Live Sequential Matching Test

**Complete end-to-end validation with real Allied Air catalog and OpenAI API**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Just run this one command:
./test.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
1. âœ… Prompt you to paste your OpenAI API key securely 
2. âœ… Build the project if needed
3. âœ… Run 12 comprehensive test scenarios
4. âœ… Show detailed results and AI reasoning
5. âœ… Provide complete performance summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What Gets Tested

### Real Allied Air Catalog (20 Products):
- Armstrong Air heat pumps (15-22 SEER)
- AirEase models (same products, different branding)
- Ducane & Armstrong 97% AFUE furnaces
- All-climate cold weather heat pumps
- Package units and air handlers

### 12 Test Scenarios:
1. **Exact SKU** â†’ Should stop at Stage 1 (95% confidence)
2. **Exact Model** â†’ Should stop at Stage 1 (85% confidence)
3. **Fuzzy Match** â†’ Should succeed at Stage 2
4. **Spec Match (HP)** â†’ Should match by tonnage/SEER at Stage 3
5. **Spec Match (Furnace)** â†’ Should match by AFUE at Stage 3
6. **Trane Heat Pump** â†’ Should use AI at Stage 4 for cross-brand
7. **Carrier Heat Pump** â†’ Should use AI for brand equivalent
8. **Lennox Furnace** â†’ Should use AI for premium brand matching
9. **Rheem Classic** â†’ Should use AI for HVAC knowledge
10. **Goodman Furnace** â†’ Should use AI for value brand recognition
11. **Pool Equipment** â†’ Should fail (not HVAC)
12. **Commercial RTU** â†’ Should fail (wrong application)

## ðŸ’¡ Sample AI Analysis

```
ðŸ¤– AI ANALYSIS:
   Match Found: true
   AI Confidence: 0.782
   AI Reasoning:
     1. Both are 3-ton residential heat pumps
     2. Similar SEER ratings (16 vs 17) within acceptable range  
     3. Compatible refrigerant types (R-410A)
     4. Equivalent residential application and capacity
   Enhanced Data: {
     "identified_specifications": {
       "tonnage": "3",
       "seer": "16", 
       "product_type": "heat_pump"
     },
     "product_category": "cooling",
     "key_features": ["scroll_compressor", "residential_application"]
   }
```

## âš¡ Quick Validation

Run this to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Check if all files exist
ls tests/data/allied-air-catalog.js tests/live-api-test.js test.sh

# Make sure it's executable  
chmod +x test.sh

# Run the test
./test.sh
```

## ðŸŽ‰ That's It!

Just run `./test.sh` and paste your API key when prompted. You'll get a complete validation of your sequential matching system with:

- **Real Allied Air product data**
- **Live OpenAI API integration** 
- **Comprehensive test scenarios**
- **Detailed performance metrics**
- **Full audit trail of processing steps**

The system will prove your AI-enhanced sequential matching works perfectly with real HVAC data! ðŸš€
